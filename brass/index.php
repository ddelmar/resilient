		<p><b>Let's reward our prisons for performance. Not for staying full.</b><br />
Prisons are not held to an expectation of performance. Simply put, we're not asking them to prove that they do what they are meant to do. Worse, thanks to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/19/private-prison-quotas_n_3953483.html" title="Prison Quotas Push Lawmakers To Fill Beds, Derail Reform" target="_blank">lockup quotas,</a> private prisons actually <i>benefit</i> from the recidivism epidemic. This is why, after <a href="http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2013/04/26/another-day-another-report-on-massachusetts-botched-prison-policies/" target="_blank" title="Boston Magazine">decades of scathing reports</a> saying that our Department of Corrections is failing to fulfill its mandate -- that is, to <i>correct</i> -- we've seen no improvement. As long as there is no incentive for our prisons to improve, they will not.
		</p>
		<p>
			There's a missing piece. Massachusetts doesn't yet have a way of comparing prisons to each other. The first hurdle is better data management. We can do that.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Behavioral Risk Assessment and Segmenting Software</b><br />
We're building software that will bring transparency to our prisons. It's a simple but important change in the way we get our metrics: by comparing similar inmates, rather than trying to compare prisons. We should be identifying behavioral profiles within each facility. If we can watch the trajectory of a man in Bridgewater against that of a similar man in South Middlesex -- and then do that at scale -- then we can begin to gain some insight into the success of those prisons. This is the first step in a domino effect. If we have the data, we can design an incentives program. With an incentives program, we can reward change and those who enact it.
