		<p class="intro">
Eight weeks can transform a young person's life. We're now recruiting instructors and mentors to join us in democratizing the tech community. Let's make it the meritocracy it should be.    </p>
		<p>
			"All eyes are on us," said Dan Mulhern, Director of Public Safety Initiatives, to a roomful of applicants to Resilient Coders Bootcamp. And he meant it. Mayor Walsh has <a href="http://cityofboston.gov/news/Default.aspx?id=20440" target="_blank" title="Mayor Walsh Announces Expansion of Boston's Successful Reentry Program, Operation Exit">thrown his support</a> behind this partnership, and even incoming US Secretary of Education John King has voiced his enthusiasm for it. The idea is an audacious one: Select a group of young people who are out of school, who are deemed to be "high risk" for their backgrounds, and give them the tools and the guidance they need to become coders. Join the initiative that's redefining workforce development.

			This fall, we'll be at 50 Milk St., 5th floor, on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:30 to 6. We don't ask you to make a commitment up front. Come once. Hang out with us. If you think you might stop by, throw us a note at david@resilientcoders.org so that we know to expect you.

		<p>
			We're doing things a little different for this next Bootcamp. One of the things that's new is that we're using Google Appointments for mentorship/instructor slots, allowing you to literally sign up for the sessions you want to join us for. All you have to do is open <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUl1RTN1NjMwanR4fGRlZmF1bHR8NjRmMjJiNGYzNTc2MDMyMDVmYzdjMGIyMmNmM2EwMzE" title="Resilient Coders Bootcamp Calendar" >this calendar,</a> skip ahead to July, pick the session(s) you're interested in, and sign up.
</p><p>
<b>When and where:</b> We'll be at the Roxbury Innovation Center in Dudley Square, from 9:30 to 2:30 daily, July 11th through August 26th. There are three main "periods" in the day: 9:30 to 11, 11 to 12, and 1 to 2:30. Some slots are one spot, some are two.
</p><p>

<b>There's no expectation of recurring commitment.</b> Come once if that's what works for you. No judgment, pinkie swear. We do ask that you commit to attending any sessions you sign up for, since you're removing it from availability.
</p><p>

<b>What's being taught? </b>This time around, we're focusing almost exclusively on front-end stuff, with a light touch on javascript and Wordpress towards the end. We chose to do this because we're treating our Bootcamp as training for <a href="/lab" title="Resilient Lab">Resilient Lab,</a> our dev shop, where our guys are paid to build websites for clients.
</p><p>

<b>What do "Maker" and "Instructor" mean?</b> Instructor means that the person to reserve this spot is expected to lead a session. If you're new to us, we'll provide guidance, and a suggested general framework. If the appointment slot isn't explicitly marked "instructor" than you're a essentially a TA, walking around and answering questions. "Maker" refers to students' self-directed learning time, during which they're working on a particular project. This is when we most need mentors, because it's when they're exploring.
</p><p>

<b>What should I expect?</b> 15 or so interested young people with little-to-no experience coding. You can see the last Bootcamp in action in <a href="http://news.wgbh.org/2016/03/29/local-news/greater-bostonian-coding-bootcamp" title="WGBH: Greater Bostonian">this piece by WGBH,</a> or, better yet, <a href="/alumni" title="Resilient Coders Bootcamp Alumni">hear our alumni</a> talk about their experience here.
</p><p>

If you can't make of these windows, don't worry about it. There will be plenty of other opportunities to get involved.
