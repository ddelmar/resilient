		<h2>Del leaves PayPal</h2>
		<p>
			After having taken a number of vacation days to teach basic coding skills to incarcerated youth, Del leaves PayPal to launch Resilient Coders.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="map-detail zone2">
		<h2>The Police Step In</h2>
		<p>
		Resilient Coders is awarded grants through the Boston Police Department, for our work with high-risk youth.
		Our city is lucky enough to have a police force that believes in finding alternate ways to reduce violence in our communities.
		They believe as we do: Careers over cuffs.
	</p>
	</div>
	<div class="map-detail zone3">
		<h2>TUGG</h2>
		<img src="i/map4_tugg.JPG" />
		<p>
			Resilient Coders is invited to join the <a href="http://tugg.org" target="_blank">TUGG</a> portfolio. As a member
			company, we're invited to compete at events at which attendees are asked to vote for a grantee from among
				competing companies. Resilient Coders wins Tech Gives Back in September 2014. We would later go on to win
				again in April, and again the following September.
		</p>
		<p>Shout outs to the TUGG team, and to its (then) Executive Director David Brown, who continues to be an immensely
			valuable ally and advisor. Special thanks to our teams of hustlers who donned the skull t-shirt and helped us
			win those events.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="map-detail zone4">
		<h2>We become legit</h2>
		<p>
			The day after winning TUGG Tech Gives Back, Resilient Coders becomes incorporated, thanks to the efforts of our
			allies Goulston Storrs. Our friends at Goulston would go on to help us achieve our 501(c)(3) status, and set up
			our legal operations. Matthew Woodbury gets a special shout out for turning an "advice" phone call into a real, tangible,
			and invaluable partnership.
		</p>
		<p>
			Eight months later, the IRS would join the throngs of people misspelling our name.
		</p>

	</div>
	<div class="map-detail zone5">
		<h2>The Board of Superhumans</h2>
		<p>
			Del finds three people with that rare blend of experience, grit, passion, and <i>com</i>passion.
			As Resilient Coders itself bridges the worlds of social justice and technology, so too does its board.
			Joshua Summers, the board's chair, is a successful serial entrepreneur, investor, and active presence in Boston's tech community.
			Susanne Beck offers her vast experience consulting with non-profits in periods of transition and growth.
			Pamela Aldsworth, manager of client relations at Silicon Valley Bank and avid supporter of TUGG, has experience
			in both tech and meaningful philanthropy.
		</p>
		<p>Around this time, three Resilient Coders attended the MassTLC UnConference, thanks to their sponsorship.
			Our Youth Dev Lead, Micah, pitched a session on code literacy in the inner city. It was at this session that our hackers
			met Chris Swenor, CEO of <a href="http://eastcoastproduct.com" target="_blank">East Coast Product,</a> who would ultimately become our Technical Advisor.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="map-detail zone6">
		<h2>Resilient Coders blows up</h2>
		<img src="i/map7_grovehall.jpg" />
		<p>
			Over the course of our first year in operation, with help from our allies, Resilient Coders reaches roughly 80 young people. We run
			small cohorts in four public schools, two community centers, two correctional institutions, and two coding camps.
		</p>
		<p>
			In every cohort, we ran deliberate and measurable tests, in order to develop a real pedagogy "on the ground."
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="map-detail zone7">
		<h2>We Launch "Coworking"</h2>
		<img src="i/map8_cic.jpg" />
		<p>
			Thanks to our partnership with <a href="http://cic.us" target="_blank">the Cambridge Innovation Center (CIC),</a>
			we launch our ongoing "Coworking" Cohort, right downtown. In this space, our hackers work elbow to elbow
			with tech innovators, and develop real relationships with them. Coworking allows us to provide our youth
			with an immersive learning environment.
		</p>
		<p>
			We want to thank CIC for their support. And we want to mention that in February, we had young people whose
			schools had closed due to snow, and <i>still</i> they would make the trek down to CIC, if we were open.
		</p>

		<h2>We send two hackers to Startup Institute</h2>
		<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JU1UunsFgpU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

		<p>
			<a href="http://startupinstitute.com" target="_blank">Startup Institute</a> is a competitive 8-week
			bootcamp focused on providing its students with the skills they need to work for a startup.
			Fredy and Micah were able to attend, thanks in no small part to scholarships from Startup Institute,
			Yelp, and a successful crowdfunding campaign. Above is our crowdfunding video.
		</p>
		<p>
			The last day of the crowdfunding campaign, someone who had already donated checked back in, to see how
			we'd fared. We were short $200. He donated again, covering the balance.
		</p>
		<p>
			He was a Startup Institute alum. He wanted Fredy and Kai to join his community.
		</p>
		<p>Shout out to Andy Laub of <a href="http://asithappens.tv" target="_blank">As It Happens Films</a>
			 for the incredible video. (Seriously though.)

		<h2>Boston Coding Camp</h2>
		<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ASKzlgmopyo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="width:100%; height:400px"></iframe>

		<p>
			Boston Coding Camp launches over spring break, in partnership with <a href="http://typp.org">The Young People's Project.</a>
			25 young people built their first websites and presented them to an audience of technologists.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thanks to our speakers, our mentors, and <a href="/camp">our sponsors</a> who made this all possible.
		</p>
		<p>Shout out to Andy Laub of <a href="http://asithappens.tv" target="_blank">As It Happens Films</a>
			 for the incredible video.

		<h2>Micah lands a job at the Boston Globe</h2>
		<img src="i/map10_kai.jpg" />
		<p>
			Our man Micah (Kai) lands a full-time software engineering job at the Boston Globe, at the age of 19.
			He still joins us at Resilient, as a mentor.
		</p>
		<p>Shout out to Andy Laub of <a href="http://asithappens.tv" target="_blank">As It Happens Films</a>
			 for the photo.

	<div class="map-detail zone11">
		<h2>Resilient Lab launches with Wanderu</h2>
		<p>
			Resilient Lab is the web design and development shop that employs the hackers who are ready for that challenge.
			We launched earlier than expected, with an awesome pilot client, Wanderu. Fredy designed the user interface
			for their iPhone app. You can read about this app in <a href="http://time.com/3714747/iphone-apps-snl/" target="_blank">TIME.</a>
			It hit #1 for the travel category the week it launched. And if you're not using it to book your ground travel,
			you're doing it wrong.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you to Wanderu for taking a chance on us.

		<h2>We win the TUGG Wine and Tequila Party</h2>
		<img src="i/map12_tugg.jpg" />
		<p>
			This time, we roll in with our young people, and let them hustle.
			Resilient Coders wins the Wine and Tequila Party, and would later go on to win
			again the following September.
		</p>
		<p>Shout outs to the TUGG team, and special thanks to our teams of hustlers who donned
			the skull t-shirt and helped us win again.
		</p>
		<p>By the way... Fredy's map shows him lifting Del up over his shoulder. That happened.

	<div class="map-detail zone13">
		<h2>Resilient Coders joins the MassChallenge cohort</h2>
		<img src="i/masschallenge.jpg" />
		<p><a href="http://masschallenge.org">MassChallenge</a> is the world's largest tech accelerator program.
			We're selected as one of the 128 MassChallenge companies in Boston, out of 2,300 applicants
			from around the world.
		</p>
		<p>We're humbled by the honor, and grateful for the enormous benefits that have come from MassChallenge -- especially
			the people we've met, who have volunteered their time and wisdom to help us improve.
		</p>
		<p>While at MassChallenge, two of our young people helped to build our curriculum platform, Scoreboard.
			They would come into the MassChallenge space, learn React, and then build. Special thanks to the Boston
			Police Department for funding this initiative, and to <a href="http://eastcoastproduct.com" target="_blank">East Coast Product</a>
			for their patience, guidance, and generosity of time.

	<div class="map-detail zone14">
		<h2>Media Leadership Institute</h2>
		<img src="i/map15_mli.jpg" />
		<p>
			Resilient Coders co-hosts the Media Leadership Institute over the summer, with our friends at
			<a href="http://www.presspasstv.org/" target="_blank">Press Pass TV</a>, designing and building a functional
			prototype	for the Mayor's Office. Our hackers craft business plans, assess the problems presented to them
			(snow removal and youth unemployment), and ultimately respond with something akin to an "uber" of snow shoveling.
		</p>
		<p>
			We have many people to thank for this one. Thanks to <a href="/camp">our sponsors</a> for the event,
			including ActBlue and Sam Adams.
			Thanks to OpenView partners, who listened to the pitches halfway through the program, offered up their
			invaluable feedback, and even
			<a href="http://blog.openviewpartners.com/resilient-coders/" target="_blank" title="Why Resilient Coders Has OpenView Excited About the Future of Boston Tech">
wrote some very kind things about us.
</a>
			Thanks to all the mentors who volunteered their time, especially the <a href="http://testive.com" target="_blank">Testive</a>,
			who showed up every week, ready to work. Thanks to Eastern Bank for the use of their space,
			to Meghan Joyce of Uber for speaking, and of course to our fantastic partners, Press Pass TV.
