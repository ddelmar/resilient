		<h2>The Coders</h2>
		<div class="product">
			<p>
Coding can be a medium of self-expression and self-discovery. Below are some examples of sites built by our student coders over the course of eight hours. These are the fruits of their hard work: their research, their self-directed learning, their collaborative problem-solving, and ultimately, their implementation. 
			</p>
			<p>
This shot of ninth-graders Lorenzo and Jahvon was taken at <a href="http://www.trinityinspires.org/teep/" target="_blank">Trinity Education for Excellence Program,</a> at which Resilient Coders is offered as a class. Students are encouraged to collaborate. They help each other when they're stuck, and they share ideas. You'll notice that many websites within a single class will share common elements, as the students learn from and inspire each other.

			<p>Lorenzo, having just scraped a site, is lending Jahvon a second pair of eyes to make sure his image references are absolute.
