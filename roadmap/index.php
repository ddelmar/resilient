				<li>Website overhauled, with student content</li>				
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Big wins from the summer and fall</h3>
			<h4 class="fall">Summer and Fall 2014</h4>
			<ul class="fall">
				<li>We have been selected to join TUGG</li>
				<li>We won TUGG's Tech Gives Back event, and took home $50k in funding</li>
				<li>We have started a cohort at Community Academy, our first forray into Boston Public Schools</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<?php /*
			<h3>2. Starting to Scale. <span class="red">Now.</span></h3>
			<h4 class="fall">Fall 2014</h4>
			<ul class="fall">
				<li>We have submitted a proposal to <a href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/Default.aspx?id=12723" target="_blank">the Mayor's RFI</a> for the Roxbury Innovation Center. This involves establishing a coalition of tech educators who would share the space, as well as lining up a brain trust of folks involved in the build up of the Boston tech community</li>
				
			</ul>
			
			
			<h3>3. Scaling. <span class="red">Yet To Do.</span></h3>
			<h4 class="september">09.2014</h4>
			<ul class="september">
				<li>Explore collaborative cohorts with organizations such as <a href="http://www.presspasstv.org/" target="_blank">PressPassTV,</a> <a href="http://www.possibleproject.org/" target="_blank">Possible Project,</a> and the Department of Youth Services</li>
				<li>Begin planning for the transition from our current ad hoc model to the longer, more rigorous model. <b>More hours. More code.</b></li>
				<li><b>Hire</b> a part-time intern for the fall (20 hrs/wk), whose tasks will be three-fold: (1) Help recruit and train volunteers. (2) Help teach. (3) Help identify partnership opportunities</li>
				<li>We hope to join the <a href="http://tugg.org" target="_blank">TUGG</a> family</li>
				
				<li>Once we have a sense for what our relationships with schools and community centers will look like in terms of hours, we'll be able to ramp up recruitment efforts, and finalize our "More hours, more code" curriculum. This will be based on the values outlined in <a href="https://delmarsenties.s3.amazonaws.com/resilient/RCCurriculum.pdf" target="_blank">this proposal</a> drafted for us by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=4306733" target="_blank">Tammy Sanders</a> and her team for the Startup Institute IdeaHack. It's a three-prong approach: (1) Learn to code (2) Personal and professional development (3) Business plan development</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>The Ultimate Vision. <span class="red">Yet To Do.</span></h3>
			<h4 class="spring">Spring 2015</h4>
			<ul class="spring">
				<li>Semester-long classes, two or three times a week. This may be either at community centers or at schools</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 class="summer">Summer 2015</h4>
			<ul class="summer">
				<li>(1) Tech bootcamp model</li>
				<li>(2) Business. Launch a design/dev studio, operated by the students. Our target clientele would be small local businesses, and we would charge them a modest hourly fee to build them a website. Students would learn how to collaborate with each other, how to communicate with a client, how to use efficiency tools such as Wordpress, how to operate against a deadline, and how to run a small business. They would be paid out of the fees charged to the client.</li>
