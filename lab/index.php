							<h5>iPhone app</h5>
							<p>The first project Resilient Lab ever tackled was UX and visual design for Wanderu's iPhone app, in December of 2014.
								Bringing the "Kayak" concept to ground travel, on a mobile device, presented us with some meaty UX challenges, on which we worked collaboratively with Wanderu's amazing team.
								</p>
									<p>
								When the iPhone app deployed, it hit #1 in the travel category of the app store. Since then, Wanderu has continued on its meteoric rise, picking up press from <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2015/03/wanderu" target="_blank" title="A Kayak for buses">The Economist,</a> <a href="http://time.com/3714747/iphone-apps-snl/" target="_blank" title="TIME">TIME,</a> <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/16/smallbusiness/richard-branson-startup-investment/" title="Is this Richard Branson's next investment?" target="_blank">CNN Money,</a> <a href="http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2016/02/25/wanderu/" target="_blank" title="Boston Magazine">Boston Magazine,</a>

							<h5>Design & Development</h5>
							<p>Our engagement with City Awake began with discussions around brand messaging, with which we worked
								closely with their team. We worked collaboratively to create wireframes, UX and visual design work, and then built for them a custom Wordpress
								theme, such that they could continue to easily edit their site. We launched the site in the summer of 2015, which served them through their festival,
								and until their acquisition by the Chamber of Commerce.

The program kicks off each April with a nomination period and culminates in September with an annual Awards Gala that draws top executives and teams from companies throughout the Commonwealth. We worked with them to design and build <a href="http://masstlcawards.org" target="_blank" title="MassTLC Awards">their website,</a> creating a custom Wordpress theme that they could continue to edit, per their needs.

							<h5>Fika Friday Web App</h5>
							<p>HelpScout has a great company tradition based on the Swedish "Fika," social coffee break. We were glad to have a chance to contribute. Using Javascript, PHP, and MySQL, we created an application that randomly pairs employees over a particular prompt, on the push of a button. New employees can just as easily be added to the pool.

			<h2>How it all works</h2>

	<p>
		<b>What sort of stuff can you do?</b> Our young people are most comfortable with relatively simple websites, and custom Wordpress theming. But our partnership with East Coast Product allows us to do pretty much anything. We've teamed up to build software using React, for example. Our friends at ECP delegated out to our students the work that was appropriate to their skills; a set that grew over the course of the project. Whether or not we're working with ECP on a particular project, every line of code that goes out is vetted by a professional. We hold our youth to professional standards.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>How does the money work?</b> Basically, half of the money that we make on a Resilient Lab project goes to pay for the wages of those who worked on it. The other half is invested in their education. The idea is that a young person will be hired to build something that lies just outside the realm of his expertise. He will be paired up with a more senior-level person who then delegates skill-appropriate work to the young person, and mentors him throughout the job. They may spend an hour learning, for every hour spent working. Our quote covers the instructor's time, and the youth coder's time, with the understanding that half of their time was spent learning.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>So, can I write it off my taxes as a donation?</b> Some of it, yes. Your invoice will itemize out the straight cost of building your project, versus the investment you're making in our coders' education. Within the hourly rate that you're quoted, usually half of that is a donation, and will be spent on training the coders to be ready to work on your project. The other half is your payment for a service. This will vary depending on the specific needs of a project. We'll be transparent about those proportions when we start.
