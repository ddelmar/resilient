		<h2>Resilient Lab</h2>
<p class="intro">
Our most experienced students operate a web design and development studio. Our young coders work with clients to build a microsite or web application. Resilient Lab represents an opportunity for both the student and the client. Students gain real, practical, hands-on experience. And clients are able to give back to the community in a way that benefits their business.
</p>
<p>
Our youth are trained to build websites, and enjoy the guidance and support of professionals.
We've designed the UI for a successful iPhone app, built websites, custom Wordpress themes, and built a curriculum platform in React. We can do it.
