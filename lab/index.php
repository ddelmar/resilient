		<h2>Resilient Lab</h2>
		<div class="product">
<p class="intro">
Our most experienced students operate a web design and development studio. Our young coders work with clients to build a microsite or web application. Resilient Lab represents an opportunity for both the student and the client. Students gain real, practical, hands-on experience. And clients are able to give back to the community in a way that benefits their business.
</p>

<h3>Two ways to partner</h3> 

<p>
<b>1. Hire us.</b> Our youth are trained to build websites, and enjoy the guidance and support of professionals. Contracts can be as simple as building a landing page for an event, such as a company holiday party, to something somewhat more involved, such as a custom Wordpress theme for a small business. Our favorite problems are the ones we haven't thought of yet. Email David Delmar at <a href="david@resilientcoders.org">david@resilientcoders.org</a> to begin scheming.
</p>
<p>
<b>2. Hire us and spend time with us.</b> Clients are uniquely positioned to provide our youth consultants with particularly enriching mentorship through this program. A client's dev team might set aside an hour or two to work alongside our youth. Or walk them through a particularly complicated step in the project. This is ideal for clients interested in giving back with their time as well as their patronage. And it's incredible for our students, who gain very real "on the job" experience.
