			<h1>Who</h1>
			<p class="intro" >
				<a href="http://resilientcoders.org" title="Resilient Coders Program" target="_blank">Resilient Coders</a> teaches at-risk youth from traditionally underserved communities how to code.
        We introduce them to a career path that is lucrative, and in high demand. Higher performers participate in <a href="http://resilientcoders.org/lab" title="Resilient Lab" target="_blank">Resilient Lab,</a> a web design and development shop with real clients.
			<p>
				At a moment at which their city is experiencing a crisis in skills gap, and struggling to find
        talent, too many Bostonians are struggling to find work. The problem is that we don’t teach our
        youth the skills that are actually in demand. And they know that.

          Why
        </h1>
        <p class="intro">
          The program hinges on one core premise: That the student is an investor of her time and energy. Let’s take a look at education from an investor’s perspective.
        </p>
        <p>Students are being asked to invest twelve years of hard work, in a social structure they often distrust, in an authority paradigm they often resent, for a return that is unclear. Similar investments have been made around them, most of them having failed to meet their promise of meaningful employment. If the return seems low,
a savvy investor will divest, in favor of opportunities with clearer opportunity for return. Many of the young people who are disengaged from school are those with high intellectual potential.

        <h1>
          Why
        </h1>
        <p class="intro">
          By the time our freshmen are looking for work, <a href="http://ow.ly/MDSae" target="_Blank">77% of available jobs will require technical skills</a> that they don’t get at school. Today’s education disparity crisis is tomorrow’s employment disparity crisis. Simply put, learning to code is a matter of social justice.

        "Our nation's outlook has worsened, our overall public school system has shown little sign of improvement, particularly in math and science, and many other nations have been markedly progressing, thereby affecting America's relative ability to compete effectively for new factories, research laboratories, administrative centers, and jobs."

        <h1>
          How
        </h1>
			<p class="intro">In order to effectively source, educate, and employ our students, we’ve developed a funnel with “overlapping” means of engagement.
			</p>
      <p>We run Coding Camps in the summer and over spring break, as a way of sourcing youth for our Coworking Cohort.
        From the Coworking Cohort, we select students for our Satellites. And our highest-performing youth are asked to
        join Resilient Lab, our web development shop that employs them at a level commensurate with their skill set.
      </p>
      <p>Bootcamp is a full-day program for high-risk youth who are no longer in school. It's 5 days a week for 8 weeks.
