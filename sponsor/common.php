			<h1>Who</h1>
			<p class="intro" >
				<a href="http://resilientcoders.org" title="Resilient Coders Program" target="_blank">Resilient Coders</a> teaches at-risk youth from traditionally underserved communities how to code.
        We introduce them to a career path that is lucrative, and in high demand. Higher performers participate in <a href="http://resilientcoders.org/lab" title="Resilient Lab" target="_blank">Resilient Lab,</a> a web design and development shop with real clients.
			<p>
				<Strong>We've had some early wins.</strong> We've sent two students to Startup Institute. One of our hackers designed the iPhone app for Wanderu, which hit #1 in its category the week it was released.
        You can read about it in <a href="http://time.com/3714747/iphone-apps-snl/" target="_blank">TIME.</a>
        Another one of our hackers is a software engineer for the Boston Globe, at the age of 19. You can see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU1UunsFgpU" target="_blank">the video</a> with which we were able to
        crowdfund his tuition to Startup Institute.

        <h1>
          Why
        </h1>
        <p class="intro">
          By the time our freshmen are looking for work, <a href="http://ow.ly/MDSae" target="_Blank">77% of available jobs will require technical skills</a> that they don’t get at school. Today’s education disparity crisis is tomorrow’s employment disparity crisis. Simply put, learning to code is a matter of social justice.

        "Our nation's outlook has worsened, our overall public school system has shown little sign of improvement, particularly in math and science, and many other nations have been markedly progressing, thereby affecting America's relative ability to compete effectively for new factories, research laboratories, administrative centers, and jobs."
