		<h1>Bootcamp</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			For young people of high risk who are no longer in high school, we run a full-day, 8-week bootcamp.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our curriculum has been designed with help from STEM education experts at MIT and Harvard.
			Students are coached along by professionals as they learn HTML, CSS, javascript, Git, Agile/Lean practices, and basic design principles.
			They also pick up soft skills, such as professional communication, collaboration, and accountability.

		</p>

		<p style="display:none;">
			Our goal is to advance our higher performers in this cohort either to Resilient Lab, or to a more aggressive bootcamp
			such as Launch Academy or Startup Institute, where they can continue their training towards employability.
		</p>

	<article>
		<h1>Bootcamp Portfolio Reel</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			At the conclusion of each cohort, we will produce a video that introduces our hackers.
			Each student will be featured in a short segment that showcases himself and his product, and
			this video will be shared and promoted through our media outlets as a part of a broader outreach initiative.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>You can help advance the mission by sponsoring one hacker through Bootcamp.</strong> That's space, staff, hardware,
			access to professional engineers, and our curriculum. We have developed three levels of support, with tiered branding opportunities
			for our sponsors.
