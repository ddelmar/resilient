		<h1>Bootcamp</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			For young people of high risk who are no longer in high school, we run a full-day, 8-week bootcamp.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our hackers are coached along by professionals as they learn HTML, CSS, javascript, Git, Agile/Lean practices, and basic design principles.
			They also pick up soft skills, such as professional communication, collaboration, and accountability.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our goal is to advance our higher performers in this cohort either to Resilient Lab, or to a more aggressive bootcamp
			such as Launch Academy or Startup Institute, where they can continue their training towards employability.
		</p>
		<p>Each student focuses on a "breakable toy" -- a project of his choosing, that he will design and build.
			The pedagogy is organically "customized" per student, as he focuses on building something about which
			he is already passionate. In other words, rather than learning to code in a broad sense, he will be learning to code his own product.
		</p>

		<h1>Bootcamp Portfolio Reel</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			At the conclusion of the program, each student will be featured in a short video that showcases himself and his product.
		</p>
		<p>
			The video will be shared and promoted through our media outlets as a part of a broader outreach initiative.
			It's important to us that the tech community get to know our hackers.
		</p>
		<p style="font-weight:bold;">There are branding opportunities on the reel for our sponsors.</p>
