			<p>This is Erik. He's one of our students with Trinity's Education for Excellence Program. Shortly after this photo was taken, he figured out how to implement a "comments" box on his site. He jumped up, hands in the air, and dropped his headphones on the floor. He'd figured it out. Everyone within arm's length was given a hand-stinging high five. 
</p><p>
There's nothing in the world quite like the moment that Erik experienced the day this photo was shot. It's addicting. It validates our efforts, and refuels the reservoir of hope from which we'll draw as we move on to the next impossible task. And as Erik progresses from this challenge to his next, his reservoir of hope, which I call resilience, will continue to mature. I believe in Erik and in his resilience. And that those of us with the greatest capacity to follow through with our challenges are also the ones with the greatest capacity to make change.
</p><p>
<span class="highlight">But these young people need more believers than just me.</span> It takes a team of other like-minded folks, across disciplines and skill sets. There is more than one way to get involved:
</p><p>
<b>1. Volunteer</b><br />
We're looking for coders with proficiency in HTML and CSS to spend an hour a week with teens, helping them learn to code.
</p><p>
<b>2. Partner</b><br />
You might be a school, a community center, or an educational program looking to incorporate Resilient Coders into your curriculum.
</p><p>
<b>3. Give</b><br />
We work with <a href="http://tsne.org" title="Third Sector New England">Third Sector New England</a> for our fiscal sponsorship, and as such are able to accept donations.

	However it is you choose to help, email me at <a href="mailto:david@resilientcoders.org">david@resilientcoders.org</a> and I will dispense one hand-stinging high five, like Erik's. The kind that makes people look to make sure everyone's okay.
