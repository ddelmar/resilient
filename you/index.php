		However it is you choose to help, email David Delmar at <a href="mailto:david@resilientcoders.org">david@resilientcoders.org</a> and we will dispense one hand-stinging high five. The kind that makes people look to make sure everyone's okay.
	</p>
<p>
<b>1. You're a coder</b><br />
And you want to use your talents to advance the cause of social justice. Roll up your sleeves and join us. There are three ways to volunteer. Read our <a href="/program">program page,</a> and then give us a shout at <a href="mailto:david@resilientcoders.org">david@resilientcoders.org.</a>

</p><p>
<b>2. You're an educational partner</b><br />
You might be a school, a community center, correctional facility, or organization looking to incorporate coding into your curriculum. We've run cohorts with Boston Public Schools, Boston Center for Youth and Families, Trinity Boston Foundation, and the Department of Youth Services. We play well with others. 
</p><p>
	
<b>3. You're a business</b><br />
Hire a small team of "youth consultants" to work alongside our mentors to solve a problem for you.
