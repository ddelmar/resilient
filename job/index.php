	<p>From July 11th through August 26th, 9:30 to 2:30 every day, a small cohort of young people of a higher risk profile than most will gather at the Roxbury Innovation Center to learn to code. The syllabus is a carefully curated combination of technical skills (HTML, CSS, and basic Javascript), verbal and nonverbal communication strategies, and open discussions meant to help our young coders place themselves in a broader social context.
</p>
<p>
We are considering two configurations:
</p>
<p>1. Hiring one instructor who has the strong technical skills to lead the workshops while also having the charisma and demeanor to manage a broad range of personalities. This person should have experience in and passion for youth development, education, and/or mentorship. It's an excellent opportunity for a freelancer to complement her workload with a steady 25 hours a week.
</p>
<p>
2. Hiring two instructors: one to lead the technical workshops, and another to lead the non-technical discussions focused more on personal and professional development, communication strategies, and social context. In this case, both should have experience in and passion for youth development, education, and/or mentorship.
</p>

<p>
We also operate a <a href="/lab" title="Resilient Lab">web development company</a> that employs our higher performers to build websites for local businesses. We pair those young people with freelancers who help vet the work. A successful technical instructor could pick up additional freelance work with us, during and/or after Bootcamp.
</p>
