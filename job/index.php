		<h2>Hello. Is it you we're looking for?</h2>

		<p class="intro">
  We're looking to make our first full-time hire. We need a hustler who is passionate, mission-driven, and comfortable in a startup environment where many hats are worn, pivots are made, and decisions are made swiftly and efficiently.
    </p>
		<p>
			This <b>Development Manager</b> is a thought leader, who has the experience and judgment to influence the direction of the company. That said, this person is also comfortable rolling up his/her sleeves and joining us in the hard work that we all share. There is no "waterfall of responsibility" here. As we preach meritocracy, we also practice it: Give us your best ideas, your time, and your sweat, and we will give you the autonomy to make this mission your own. As we tell our young people: Come hungry.
		</p>
		<p>
		What we need is someone who can lead both business development, and program coordination. We're looking for someone who has not only experience, but also innovative ideas when it comes to designing and executing a fundraising strategy. We've all gotten those lame fundraising communications. How would you do it differently?
	</p>
	<p>
		This person will also help us run the program. Identify key technologists who should come in and lead a workshop. Keep an eye out for VIP's or organizations who might be instrumental to the advancement of the cause.
	</p>
	<p>
		Be able to speak to your...
	</p>
	<ul>

		<li>Prior multi-faceted fundraising strategy that you've designed and implemented</li>
		<li>Metrics-based decision-making</li>
		<li>Experience cultivating relationships with potential donors, partners</li>
		<li>Broad professional network in the field</li>
		<li>Experience at a small shop or startup</li>
		<li>Evidence of thought leadership</li>
		<li>Vision as to how Resilient Coders could have deeper impact</li>
	</ul>
	<p style="padding-top:20px;">

		<b>Why you want to work with us</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		Resilient Coders is only a year old but we're already making some noise. We've launched our web dev shop, Resilient Lab, earlier than expected, and have worked with awesome clients like Wanderu and City Awake. We've picked up some love from the tech community: We've won TUGG's event-based competitions three times consecutively, and we've been selected as finalists at MassChallenge. We've picked up <a href="/press">some press</a> here and there, from the Metro, the Herald, Boston Magazine, to our recent TEDx talk. Still, nobody articulates our culture better than our man Micah does in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU1UunsFgpU">this 3-minute video.</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		This is what we've done in year one. Help us define year two. Send your resume and cover letter to <a href="mailto:hiring@resilientcoders.org">hiring@resilientcoders.org.</a>
</p>
<p>
		Onward.
