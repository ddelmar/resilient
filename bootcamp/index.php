		<h2>Bootcamp</h2>

		<p class="intro">
Eight weeks can transform a young person's life. We're now recruiting instructors and mentors to join us in democratizing the tech community. Let's make it the meritocracy it should be.    </p>

			"All eyes are on us," said Dan Mulhern, Director of Public Safety Initiatives, to a roomful of applicants to Resilient Coders Bootcamp. And he meant it. Mayor Walsh has <a href="http://cityofboston.gov/news/Default.aspx?id=20440" target="_blank" title="Mayor Walsh Announces Expansion of Boston's Successful Reentry Program, Operation Exit">thrown his support</a> behind this partnership, and even incoming US Secretary of Education John King has voiced his enthusiasm for it. The idea is an audacious one: Select a group of young people who are out of school, who are deemed to be "high risk" for their backgrounds, and give them the tools and the guidance they need to become coders. Join the initiative that's redefining workforce development.
