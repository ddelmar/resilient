<h3>Popup Cohorts</h3>
<p>
These are partner-based cohorts, taught at <b>schools, correctional facilities, and community centers.</b> They are often part of an existing program, and allow us to source students for our Coworking initiative. The objective is to spark an interest in technology, and recruit interested students. A Popup cohort is eight hours long. Usually 1 hour a week for 8 weeks, or 2 hours a week for 4 weeks. Students are expected to produce a simple HTML/CSS website. You can see examples of work produced during a Popup Cohort on our <a href="/students" class="external">students page.</a>
</p>
<p>
To help us keep the mission sustainable, we invite our supporters and our partners to make a one-time donation to help us bring Resilient to a particular school or community center.
</p>
<p><b>Interested in volunteering?</b><br/>
We ask our volunteers to commit to an entire cohort, which is usually eight weeks long, an hour a week. Most of our Popup Cohorts are right after school, and so tend to take place around 3pm. We do run an evening cohort in Dorchester. Email us for details.
</p>
<p>
If you're not ready to commit to a Popup Cohort, we'd encourage you to volunteer for either <a class="coworking" href="#" onclick="return false;">Coworking</a> or for <a class="resilient" href="#" onclick="return false;">Resilient Lab.</a> They both take place downtown around 4:30pm. You'd stop by with your laptop and code with us. That's about it.
</p>
<p>
<b>Where are the details?</b><br />
We don't give too many details online regarding our Popup Cohorts because we'd rather not have people "drop in." We like to get to know our friends before inviting them over. Give us a shout to learn more.
<p>
<p>
Email David at <a href="mailto:david@resilientcoders.org" class="external">david@resilientcoders.org</a> to get involved.

<h3>Coworking</h3>

<p>We believe in "HOMAGO," which stands for "Hang Out. Mess Around. Geek Out." Seymour Papert's learning theory of Constructionism stipulates that the best learning happens when you have hands-on experience, as well as room for exploration, thinking and reflection, rather than transmission of knowledge from teacher to student. Coworking presents our students with an opportunity to hang out in a safe space together, meet other young coders, and interact with tech professionals as they further explore web development at their pace. Coworking also provides an opportunity for employment for our higher performers, as they earn a stipend to mentor newer students. 
</p>
<p>
Students are sourced from our <a class="popup" href="#" onclick="return false;">Popup Cohorts.</a> And it's from this pool that we staff <a class="resilient" href="#" onclick="return false;">Resilient Lab.</a>
</p>
<p><b>Interested in volunteering?</b><br/>
Coworking is the easiest way to volunteer. Join us downtown, bring your laptop. Help our young people code.

<h3>Resilient Lab</h3>
<p>This is a web design and development studio operated by the more experienced youth from <a class="coworking" href="#" onclick="return false;">Coworking.</a> They work with a client to build a microsite or web application, for pay. Clients are encouraged to treat this as an opportunity to play an active role in the student's learning experience. Ideally, a client company will provide a technical volunteer who will help coach the students through the task. The student then gains real experience building product, and develops a relationship with a mentor working in the field.
