		<h2>Coding Camps and Partnerships</h2>
		<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ASKzlgmopyo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="width:100%; height:200px"></iframe>

		<p style="margin-top:20px;">We source our students from our partnerships with organizations such as Youth Options Unlimited,
			the Department of Youth Services, and the Boston Private Industry Council. We also run Coding Camps
			to expose new students to coding. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Our objective at the top of the funnel is for students to progress to the next step along the process.

		<h2>Coworking and Satellites</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Coworking</strong><br />
		On Tuesdays and Thursdays, our dedicated group of young people join us at CIC Boston's coworking space,
		in which they are surrounded by tech entrepreneurs. Most of these youth have joined us through referrals
		from a variety of different programs, including Youth Options Unlimited, the Boston Private Industry Council,
		and the Department of Youth Services.
	</p>
	<p>We believe that the best learning happens when you have hands-on experience,
		as well as room for exploration, thinking and reflection, rather than transmission of knowledge from teacher to student.
		Coworking presents our students with an opportunity to hang out in a safe space together, meet other young coders,
		and interact with tech professionals as they further explore web development at their pace.
		<br /><br />
		<strong>Satellites</strong><br />
 		Satellites are Coworking Cohorts held "away," at offices including the Microsoft NERD Center,
		giving our more experienced youth a deeper level of exposure into careers in technology.
</p>

	<div class="detail funnel3">
		<h2>Bootcamp</h2>
		<p>
		 Our full-day "bootcamp" model is offered in partnership with the Mayor's Office of Public Safety, to young people who are not in school.
Students meet for five hours a day, five days a week, for 8 weeks. During this time, they are working out of a coworking space,
receiving instruction and direct mentorship from tech professionals. The program is built around key
"milestones," identified in our curriculum and informed by the needs of the market.

		<h2>Resilient Lab</h2>
		<p>We run a web development shop that provides meaningful employment opportunities for our highest-performing youth.
			Client projects include design and development of <a href="http://cityawake.is" target="_blank">City Awake,</a> and designing the interface for the iPhone app released by Wanderu, a local tech startup.
