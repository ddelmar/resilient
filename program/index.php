<h3>Three-Part Program</h3>

<img src="https://delmarsenties.s3.amazonaws.com/resilient/3model.svg" class="program_3model" />

<h3>1. Popup ("Teaser") Cohort.</h3>
<p>
These are partner-based cohorts, taught at <b>schools, correctional facilities, and community centers.</b> They are often part of an existing program, and allow us to source students for our Coworking initiative. The objective is to spark an interest in technology, and recruit interested students. A Popup cohort is eight hours long. Usually 1 hour a week for 8 weeks, or 2 hours a week for 4 weeks. Students are expected to produce a simple HTML/CSS website. You can see examples of work produced during a Popup Cohort on our <a href="/students">students page.</a>
</p>
<p>
To help us keep the mission sustainable, we invite our supporters and our partners to make a one-time donation to help us bring Resilient to a particular school or community center.
</p>

<h3>2. Coworking</h3>
<p>We believe in "HOMAGO," which stands for "Hang Out. Mess Around. Geek Out." Seymour Paert's learning theory of Constructionism stipulates that the best learning happens when you have hands-on experience, as well as room for exploration, thinking and reflection, rather than transmission of knowledge from teacher to student. Coworking presents our students with an opportunity to hang out in a safe space together, meet other young coders, and interact with tech professionals as they further explore web development at their pace. Coworking also provides an opportunity for employment for our higher performers, as they earn a stipend to mentor newer students. 
</p>

<h3>3. Resilient Lab</h3>
<p>This is a web design and development studio operated by more experienced youth. They work with a client to build a microsite or web application, for pay. Clients are encouraged to treat this as an opportunity to play an active role in the student's learning experience. Ideally, a client company will provide a technical volunteer who will help coach the students through the task. The student then gains real experience building product, and develops a relationship with a mentor working in the field.
</p>

<h3>The Big Picture</h3>
<p>
A student's growth through Resilient Coders might look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>She attends a Resilient Coders class offered at her school. 
</li><li>After the 8 weeks are over, she joins us downtown for Coworking after school.
</li><li>She's hired as a mentor.
</li><li>She works as part of a team, for a real client.
	</li>
</ul>
