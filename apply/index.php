Eight weeks can transform a young person's life. We're now recruiting instructors and mentors to join us in democratizing the tech community. Let's make it the meritocracy it should be.    </p>

			"All eyes are on us," said Dan Mulhern, Director of Public Safety Initiatives, to a roomful of applicants to Resilient Coders Bootcamp. And he meant it. Mayor Walsh has <a href="http://cityofboston.gov/news/Default.aspx?id=20440" target="_blank" title="Mayor Walsh Announces Expansion of Boston's Successful Reentry Program, Operation Exit">thrown his support</a> behind this partnership, and even incoming US Secretary of Education John King has voiced his enthusiasm for it. The idea is an audacious one: Select a group of young people who are out of school, who are deemed to be "high risk" for their backgrounds, and give them the tools and the guidance they need to become coders. Join the initiative that's redefining workforce development.

			We're looking for young people from the City of Boston, who face more challenges than most, to join us for seven weeks, to learn the fundamentals of web development.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>We...</b> will teach you HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. We hire a few students out of our Bootcamps, into a part-time apprenticeship program at our <a href="/lab">web development company,</a> during which they build
			websites for clients.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>You...</b> are between the ages of 17 and 26. You have a high school diploma or equivalency. You live in the City of Boston, from a community traditionally underrepresented in technology.
			You may not know how to code, but you're interested in learning. You'd be available for an apprenticeship after the Bootcamp.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>The next Bootcamp...</b> will be at the Roxbury Innovation Center, in Dudley Square, from July 11th through August 26th. We'll meet there daily, from 9:30 to 2:30.
			To apply, you must attend the next Hackathon (below). If you're not able to attend the next Hackathon, but you still feel you might be a fit for Bootcamp, email us
			at <a href="mailto:apply@resilientcoders.org">apply@resilientcoders.org</a> on or before June 10th, with your name, age, neighborhood, and reason for which you're interested in Bootcamp.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>The next Hackathon...</b> will be on June 10th 2016, from 10 to 5, at the Maverick Landing Community Center. That's at 31 Liverpool Street in East Boston. You can sign up
			with our partners at <a href="http://eastiecoders.com" title="Sign up at Eastie Coders">EastieCoders.com</a>
