	<b>The Boston Police Department</b><br />
We're indebted to the BPD Grants office; particularly to Cheryl Joyce, Laura Gross, Jason Whyte, and Demon Bills. They have been early and steadfast believers in Resilient Coders, and have prodivded us with the funding necessary to begin teaching behind bars.

<p>
<b>TUGG</b><br />Resilient Coders is one of the new members of the TUGG portfolio, and the winner of <a href="http://tugg.org/techgivesback" target="_blank">Tech Gives Back</a> 2014. We're enormously grateful to TUGG, and to its supporters.

<b>Goulston & Storrs</b><br />
Our friends at Goulston and Storrs are generously donating their time with legal matters. We especially want to thank Matt Woodbury and Linh Lingenfelter for their enormous help and guidance.

<b>Allies</b><br />
We've been lucky enough to work with some great change-makers in the space, including the Trinity Boston Foundation, Press Pass TV, the Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics, the Startup Institute, the Boston Center for Youth and Families, and of course the Department of Youth Services.
