				<!--Resilient Coders Bootcamp 2016 ends today.-->
				Resilient Coders teaches young people from traditionally underserved communities how to code. We do this as a way of aligning them with a lucrative and meaningful career path. It's a <a href="/program" title="Resilient Coders Program">multi-tiered program</a> that funnels students from learning HTML after school, through our downtown "Coworking" sessions, and ultimately, hourly employment. Our higher performers participate in <a href="/lab" title="Resilient Lab">Resilient Lab,</a> a web design and development shop with real clients.
			</p>
			<p>

		There is more than one way to join the code literacy movement. Coders: Help us teach. Business owners: Hire Resilient Lab to work on your web presence. Learn more about <a href="/mentor" title="Get Involved">how to get involved as a mentor,</a> or just email us at <a href="mailto:david@resilientcoders.org">david@resilientcoders.org</a>

			Learning by failing
		</h2>
		<p>
Our approach to coding is a little different from traditional education. We learn by doing things wrong. We scrape, we tweak, we break. And then we iterate, each time failing smarter than the last. Our objective is not a scholastic one; we aim to acquire a skill that can gainfully employ someone who has the resilience to learn by failure.
