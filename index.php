		<h2>Hacking the opportunity gap</h2>
		<div class="product">
			<p>
				Resilient Coders is a free, volunteer-based program focused on making web technology more available to kids who might not otherwise be exposed to it. Each student builds his or her own website, coached along by a web professional.
			<br /><br />
		<b>It's good for the student</b><br />
		A student could have an innate gift for web development, and just never have an opportunity to explore it. He may not have the right role model, or live in a community that values it. If we were to just introduce the basics to these kids, we might awaken the curiosity of one such student, and begin to bridge the opportunity gap in that one case.
		<br /><br />
		<b>The tech world needs these kids</b><br />
		While 7% of Americans can't find work, the tech industry still struggles to find talent. There simply aren't enough people in the workforce to satisfy a market hungry for certain skill sets. The local tech community stands to benefit from an investment in programs that expand the talent pool, and open the doors to young people from communities traditionally underrepresented in technology.

		<h2>
			Learning by failing
		</h2>
		<p>
Our approach to coding is a little different from traditional education. We learn by doing things wrong. We scrape, we tweak, we break. And then we iterate, each time failing smarter than the last. Our objective is not a scholastic one; we aim to acquire a skill that can gainfully employ someone who has the resilience to learn by failure. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Better ROI.</b> Young people will invest their talent and energy wherever they see most opportunity for return. And while talent and energy are broadly consistent across neighborhoods, opportunities are not. So youth in underserved communities invest accordingly, "hustling" wherever they see the most chance for personal success. We present ourselves as another option: Hustle smarter. The same character traits that get a student kicked out of school can make him successful, if he sees an opportunity. They say you shouldn't try to stop a runaway train, when you can just switch the tracks and still leverage all that good momentum. </p>
