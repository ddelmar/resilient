		<h2>Coding Camps</h2>
<p class="intro">
	The camps we co-host over the summer and spring break represent an opportunity for
	young people from communities traditionally underrepresented in
	technology to learn to code. Students are taught by professionals,
	and coached along by their peers, as they build their first web applications. During that time,
	they'll learn HTML/CSS, pick up Agile/Lean practices, meet local tech entrepreneurs and engineers,
	and then present their work at Demo Day.
</p>
<p>
 	<b>What does it mean to be a mentor?</b> We're looking for hacktivists like ourselves. We are designers and developers
	who believe that being able to code can provide Boston's youth with a path towards meaningful employment.
	If you're interested in getting involved, and you're curious as to the schedule, the curriculum, and
	level of time commitment, you can learn some of those details in this PDF we hand out to new mentors.
