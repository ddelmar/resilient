								Will Osorio

							<div class="clr"></div>
							<p>
Will caught <a href="http://elplaneta.com/news/2015/feb/06/boston-iniciativa-jovenes-latinos-aprenden-coding/" title="El Planeta">an article</a> in El Planeta and decided to join Resilient Coders.
He learned HTML and CSS, moving on quickly to JavaScript. When we parnered up with <a href="http://eastcoastproduct.com" title="East Coast Product">East Coast Product</a> to build some software,
Will was part of the <a href="/lab" title="Resilient Lab">Resilient Lab</a> team, learning React while he <a href="https://twitter.com/resilientcoders/status/624594988064608256" title="Twitter | MassChallenge">built</a>. From there, he joined Launch Academy, where he learned rails-based programming. These days, he works at HubLogix.

							<p>
								During his time with Resilient Lab, Brian worked closely with the team at <a href="http://eastcoastproduct.com" title="East Coast Product">East Coast Product</a>,
								helping to conduct user research for a unique project: a web application meant to unite efforts
								across organizations in Boston fighting for equity, with a focus on black and Latino boys. It's Boston's response
								to President Obama's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/my-brothers-keeper" title="My Brother's Keeper">My Brother's Keeper</a> initiative.
								Since then, he's further honed his <a href="http://madrigalbrian.github.io/" title="Brian Madrigal">skills</a> as a UX/UI designer/dev, thanks largely to his time at Startup Institute.
								And these days, he's participating in Fresh Tilled Soil's competitive UX apprenticeship.

								Fredy is a talented <a href="https://twitter.com/resilientcoders/status/661985510886363140" title="Twitter | City Awake Banner">artist</a> and designer from Hyde Park, and inaugural member of <a href="/lab" title="Resilient Lab">Resilient Lab.</a>
								He worked on the UX and visual design for Wanderu's iPhone app, which was a hit. The week it deployed, it leapt to #1 for its category in the App Store.

								He also illustrated <a href="/map" title="Year One">this incredible interactive map</a> of our first year in operation.

								Micah Martin
							</h2>
							<div class="clr"></div>
							<p>
								Micah ("Kai") is an ambitious young technologist and entrepreneur. Shortly after his joining Resilient Coders,
								we teamed with our friend Andy Laub of <a href="http://asithappens.tv" title="As It Happens">As It Happens Creative</a> to produce a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU1UunsFgpU">short video</a>. It
								drove a successful IndieGoGo campaign, with which we were able to send him and Fredy to Startup Institute. From there, Kai
								was hired as a full stack web developer at the Boston Globe.
							</p>
							<p>
								But Kai is more than a coder. He's also a vocal advocate for his community. He's <a href="https://twitter.com/CodeForBoston/status/607343871304077312" >spoken</a> at events like Code for Boston's Ignite, and
								he's <a href="https://twitter.com/resilientcoders/status/598261630267457537">taught</a> countless young hackers some basic javascript. Recently, Kai was <a href="https://twitter.com/brinchartier/status/735627763261018112">awarded</a> the MITX Future Leaders Award.</p>
								<p>Just a year and half after saying into the camera, "I'm trying to make somebody to look up to," Kai stepped onstage, in his red Nikes and a hoodie, and into the spotlight.

								Jean Exavier ("Ex")

							<div class="clr"></div>

								Ex's time at Resilient Coders was bookended by a pair of BostInno pieces. The <a hef="http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2015/10/19/coding-skills-how-to-spot-and-hire-engineering-talent/" title="Resilient Coders' David Delmar: How to Spot Coding Talent Early">first</a> was about the potential we saw in him.
								The <a href="http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2016/05/31/resilient-coders-grad-takes-development-internship-at-the-grommet/" title="How 20-year-old Jean Exavier Went From Skateboarder to Web Developer">second</a> was about his placement at The Grommet as a UI Engineer intern, where he is today.
								He took to JavaScript like a moth to flame, always pushing to do stuff like building a <a href="https://twitter.com/WhyNotDoStuff/status/707338123693465601">Twitter news feed.</a> He worked, through the <a href="/lab">Lab,</a> on a JavaScript-based web application
								for <a href="http://helpscout.com">HelpScout,</a> enabling their company-wide tradition of matching employees randomly over a prompt. Ex has been a mentor among his fellow
								coders, challenging them, just as he challenges himself.

Johan Baez rose to the top of Resilient's first-ever Bootcamp, putting in extra hours to build a site for his family's Spanish restaurant in Dorchester.
WGBH aired <a href="http://news.wgbh.org/2016/03/29/local-news/greater-bostonian-coding-bootcamp">a story on us,</a> featuring Johan, and his take on the Bootcamp.
Since then, he's picked up expertise in responsive design and UI dev while building websites for clients, through his apprenticeship at the <a href="/lab">Lab.</a>
He's a beast on semantically-structured HTML, CSS, javascript, jQuery, and is actively looking for work as his apprenticeship wraps up.

			<h2>Some of us</h2><div class="clr"></div>

				Everyone who walks in the door learns <i>at least</i> semantically-structured HTML, well-written CSS with
				responsive design, and javascript. Where and how our hackers choose to expand beyond that base is what marks an individual.
				Every student is expected to bring his or her own heat. Some bring fire.
