			<h2>Bootcamp winter 2016</h2><div class="clr"></div>
			<p>
				Meet some of the members of our pilot cohort. These young men gathered at MassChallenge every day, over the course of eight weeks,
				to gain critical skills in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, git, and Bootstrap. They received instruction
				from professional engineers and designers. They held discussions around community issues
				and how we might be empowered to tackle them, together. And now they're looking for their
				next big challenge. <br /><br />
				Reach out to <a href="mailto:david@resilientcoders.org">david@resilientcoders.org</a> to
